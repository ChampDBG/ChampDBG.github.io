Yesterday, I found there is a discussion [[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49090448/how-can-i-use-cython-to-speed-up-the-numpy)] implies the possibility to speed up more in Cython with class. Therefore, I wrote a class version for cliffwalk.

I refered tutroial [[2](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/cdef_classes.html)] and Dr. Stefan Behnel's slide [[3](http://www.behnel.de/cython200910/talk.html)] to program and the class version of cliffwalk is [[here](https://github.com/ChampDBG/PlayGround/tree/master/cython/cliffwalk_v3)]. There is a extra function (exec_cliffwalk) in the cy_cliffwalk.pyx for easy to call from outside and here is the result.

Although Cython version is still the fastest　one, we got worse performance than yesterday (average 0.82). Comparing to yesterday, there is no siginficant performance difference in Python version (average 1.68) and naive Cython version (average 1.65).

Actually, I have no idea about why performance get worse so much, so I use cython buildin function to observe where may can modify. With the following command
```bash
$ cython -a ./cy_cliffwalk.pyx
```

and it will generate a html file. After open the html, there are some lines were highlighted. It means that cython and python interact at this line. In other word, there are the places that may make your script slow down, so it is better to turn them into to Cython version.

I did lots of accesses from the array, using memroyview may be a better choice [[4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50086564/cython-index-should-be-typed-for-more-efficient-access)]. Therefore, I modified the class script with memoryview's tutorial [[5](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html)] [[6](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#format-characters)], revised the declaration of related variables and remove some numpy function to buildin function. There is the [new version](https://github.com/ChampDBG/PlayGround/blob/master/cython/cliffwalk_v3/cy_cliffwalk_v2.pyx).

I look better now, but still have a little distance to function version. I tried to simpify some unnecessary part in class version and there is the [version 3](https://github.com/ChampDBG/PlayGround/blob/master/cython/cliffwalk_v3/cy_cliffwalk_v3.pyx).

I think there is little difference between version 2 and 3, but it finally has similar performance to function version. However, I think class version is more convenient for me to handle whole project, so I will use class version if it has similar speed as function version.

## All in all
According to this cython series, I think fine-tuned cython script can give you large bonus on heavy calculation. The fine-tuned may be
* appropriate declaration

* builtin function in cython (ex: memoryview, declare contiguous array...)

* Turn off bounds checking and warparound [[7](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/numpy.html#tuning-indexing-further)] (I didn't test this part)

* find the bottleneck with ```cython -a FILENAME.pyx```

There are lots of things I haven't tried yet. For example, calling C/C++ function [[8](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/external.html)][[9](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/clibraries.html)], import C/C++ script [[10](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/external_C_code.html)] into cython or release cython from GIL [[11](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/parallelism.html)]. It means that, my cython script might be faster than now, but you have to balance whether it is worth it or not.

## Future work
1. GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)

2. Making my life harder with importing C/C++ into cython

3. [One day] Making life easier with Julia
